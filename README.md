### Overview

An SMS message to cohort of users to try to convert them to a digital product.
Through this A/B test I wanted to see which of the message variations was more successful, to
then use it for a bigger cohort of users.

For each of the message variation in the A/B test I am calculating:

* The acquisition funnel:
    * click through value, how many users clicked on the link we added in the sms
    * join value, how many users joined the platform after receiving the message
* The engagement funnel:
    * contribution value, how many members have posted a message in the platform
* Check which, if any, of the message variation had better click through `RATE` than the control group (variation 1 was the control group)
    * Our hypothesis was that the generic message (variation 1) would have had a lower click through rate and join rate
      than the user-based value propositions (other variations in the test)
    * Test if the hypothesis is true and if it is statistically significant
* Presenting my results visually
